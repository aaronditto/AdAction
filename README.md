###Step 1

Write some code that prints out the following for a contiguous range of numbers:

  1. the number
  2. 'fizz' for numbers that are multiples of 3
  3. 'buzz' for numbers that are multiples of 5
  4. 'fizzbuzz' for numbers that are multiples of 15

e.g. if I run the program over a range from 1-20 I should get the following output:

    1 2 fizz 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz 13 14 fizzbuzz 16 17 fizz 19 buzz

###Step 2

*Enhance your existing FizzBuzz solution to perform the following:*

If the number contains a three you must output the text 'lucky'. This overrides any existing behaviour

e.g. if I run the program over a range from 1-20 I should get the following output:

    1 2 lucky 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz lucky 14 fizzbuzz 16 17 fizz 19 buzz

###Step 3

*Enhance your existing solution to perform the following:*

Produce a report at the end of the program showing how many times the following were output:

  1. Fizz
  2. Buzz
  3. Fizzbuzz
  4. Lucky
  5. an integer

e.g. if I run the program over a range from 1-20 I should get the following output:

    1 2 lucky 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz lucky 14 fizzbuzz 16 17 fizz 19 buzz

  1. Fizz: 4
  2. Buzz: 3
  3. Fizzbuzz: 1
  4. Lucky: 2
  5. Integer: 10

 (Integer is 10 because there were 10 numbers that were not altered in any way).
